DevSoc Core Assignments 2025-26


Welcome to the repository for the **DevSoc Core Assignment 2025-26**! This project is part of the core application for the **Development Society (DevSoc)** at BITS Pilani.

## Contents

- `DevSoc_project.ipynb` : The main Google Colab notebook containing code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating machine learning models on the obesity risk classification task using ensemble techniques.

- `DevSoc_REPORT.pdf` : A detailed LaTeX report explaining the approach, dataset, algorithms used, and results, including metrics and confusion matrices.

- `README.md` : This file. Provides a quick overview of the project, structure, and instructions.

## Overview

This assignment focuses on solving a **multi-class classification problem** to predict an individual's obesity level using health, lifestyle, and demographic features. The objective is to demonstrate understanding and implementation of core machine learning techniques, with special emphasis on **ensemble learning**.

The following models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Soft Voting Ensemble

Evaluation metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Macro F1 Score**, and **Confusion Matrix** were used to assess model performance.

> **NOTE:** Run all code cells in the `.ipynb` notebook sequentially for proper functioning and results.
