## üß† Project Summary

This submission contains two core AI/ML projects:

1. **Obesity Risk Prediction** using ensemble machine learning techniques
2. **MNIST Digit Classification** using a fully manual neural network built from scratch using only NumPy (no ML libraries)

## üìí Notebooks

### 1. `2024ADPS0026G_ObesityRiskPrediction.ipynb`

> Predicts an individual‚Äôs obesity category based on lifestyle, health, and demographic features.

Includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Baseline model (Logistic Regression)
- Ensemble models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- Soft Voting Ensemble
- Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Clear visualization of model performance

### 2. `2024ADPS0026G_MNIST_Neural_Network_From_Scratch.ipynb`

> A full neural network implementation without using any ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Includes:
- Forward and backward propagation
- ReLU and softmax activation
- Cross-entropy loss
- Manual weight updates with SGD
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and weight visualization
- Trained on MNIST dataset with 97.9%+ test accuracy

## üìÑ Report

The compiled LaTeX report [`DevSoc_REPORT.pdf`](./DevSoc_REPORT.pdf) includes:

- Overview of both projects
- Methodology and implementation details
- Mathematical formulations
- Evaluation metrics, results tables, and plots
- Visualizations (confusion matrices, first-layer weights)
