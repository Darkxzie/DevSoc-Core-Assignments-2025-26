DevSoc Core Assignments 2025-26


Welcome to the repository for the **DevSoc Core Assignment 2025-26**! This project is part of the core application for  **(DevSoc)**.

## Project Summary

This project focuses on solving a multi-class classification problem to predict an individual’s obesity level based on lifestyle, health, and demographic features & also how to build a Nueral Network from scratch without the use of tensorflow or any libraries. 

## Notebooks

### 1. DevSoc_Ensemble_Project.ipynb  
Implements a complete machine learning pipeline using ensemble methods:

- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Soft Voting Ensemble

Evaluation is performed using accuracy, macro-averaged F1 score, and confusion matrices. Visualizations are included for comparison and interpretation.

### 2. DevSoc_NeuralNet_From_Scratch.ipynb  
Builds a multi-class classification neural network from the ground up using only NumPy.  
Includes:

- Forward and backward propagation
- Softmax output layer
- Cross-entropy loss
- Manual weight updates using gradient descent

This notebook is meant to reinforce fundamental understanding of neural network mechanics.

## Report

The LaTeX report `DevSoc_REPORT.pdf` provides:
